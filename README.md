# ✉️ SMS Spam Detection
This project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning to classify SMS messages as spam or ham (not spam). It covers the full pipeline from data cleaning and feature extraction to model training and evaluation.

🛠 Tech Stack
Python

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn

NLTK / spaCy

Jupyter Notebook

🔍 Features
Text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization)

Feature extraction using techniques like Bag-of-Words and TF-IDF

Model training using classifiers such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and SVM

Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix

📁 Dataset
The dataset contains labeled SMS messages classified as spam or ham.

🚀 Future Improvements
Hyperparameter tuning

Adding deep learning models (e.g., LSTM)

Deploying the model as a web app or API using Flask or Streamlit
